Welcome to "The Land of Bloks"! "The Land of Bloks" is a game where you can explore, build and battle!

The goal of the game is to get 3000 coins. If you do, you win!

All players start out with 70 health. For every 100 coins you get, your maximum health upgrades +10.

You can collect coins by either digging from a gold mine, killing a person with a weapon, or by automatically
getting gold with a windmill. If you kill a person, you get the amount of gold that person had, divided in half,
rounded up.

If you happen to die in any way, you respawn with a standard tool, a wooden wall, and a windmill in your inventory.
The amount of coins you spawn with is the amount of coins you had, divided in half, rounded up. You start with 0 XP.

Thankfully, you get to keep all of the things you built on the map. 

To collect resources, you should use a tool. All weapons can collect resources except the bow.
Some tools are better than others, for example the axe is better than the standard tool.
You need to be one block away from the tree, mine, et cetera to be able to get resources from it.

You can use these resources to build things, for example walls. It's a good idea to stock up on resources
so that you can build a base, where you are pretty safe from enemies. Enemies can use weapons (like swords)
to hurt you!

If you get hurt and want to heal yourself, you can eat food. You get 5 health back for every piece of food you eat.

Your inventory holds all of the things that you are allowed to build. It also contains your tools. For every 100
XP you get, you get to add another item to your inventory.

For every thing you hit, including trees, mines, walls, et cetera, you get 1 XP. If you kill a person, you get 50 XP.
